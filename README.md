Binary Adder-Subtractor
Overview
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a Binary Adder-Subtractor along with a testbench for verifying its functionality. The module can perform both addition and subtraction of binary numbers based on a control signal.

Files
binary_adder_subtractor.v
This file contains the Verilog code for the binary adder-subtractor module. The module takes two binary inputs and a control signal to determine whether to perform addition or subtraction.

binary_adder_subtractor_testbench.v
The testbench file is used to verify the functionality of the binary adder-subtractor module by simulating various test cases for both addition and subtraction.

Features
Supports n-bit binary addition and subtraction.
Configurable bit-width for operations.
Testbench included for verifying functionality.
Modular and scalable design for easy integration into larger systems.
Requirements
Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Icarus Verilog)
Basic knowledge of Verilog and digital design.
Usage
Simulation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-adder-subtractor.git
cd binary-adder-subtractor
Compile the Verilog source code and testbench using your preferred simulator:

bash
Copy code
iverilog -o adder_subtractor binary_adder_subtractor.v binary_adder_subtractor_testbench.v
Run the simulation:

bash
Copy code
vvp adder_subtractor
View the output waveforms (if using a waveform viewer):

bash
Copy code
gtkwave dumpfile.vcd
Module Inputs/Outputs
Inputs:
A: First n-bit binary input.
B: Second n-bit binary input.
Control: Control signal to switch between addition (0) and subtraction (1).
Outputs:
Result: n-bit result of the operation (sum or difference).
CarryOut: Carry or borrow out signal (depends on operation).
Overflow: Indicates if an arithmetic overflow occurred.
Testbench
The testbench provides various test cases for both addition and subtraction operations. You can modify the test cases in the binary_adder_subtractor_testbench.v file to explore additional scenarios.

Future Enhancements
Extend the module to handle signed binary numbers.
Implement a ripple-carry or look-ahead carry for faster addition/subtraction.
Add more comprehensive test cases, including edge cases like overflow conditions.
